The distribution of the 'Tenure Months' column indicated that it was going a good predictive feature.

The distribution of the 'Contract' column for Churn clients indicated that it was going a good predictive feature.

By looking at the correlation between the various columns, we noticed that all the categorical columns that contains a category 'No internet service' is in fact a perfect replica of the columns 'Internet Service' with the category value of 'No'.

Therefore, all categorical columns containing the category 'No internet service' were cleaned, with the exception of the column 'Internet Service'.

# Our models

### **Logistic Regression**

The best parameters for the Logistic Regression model are {'C': 100, 'max_iter': 10000, 'penalty': 'l1', 'solver': 'liblinear', 'tol': 0.01}.

The features used to build the logistic regression model are the 5 most correlated columns with the Churn Value column.

| Feature                         | Importance |
|--------------------------------|:----------:|
| Tenure Months                 | 0.3522     |
| Internet Service_Fiber optic   | 0.3080     |
| Contract_Two year             | 0.3023     |
| Payment Method_Electronic check | 0.3019     |
| Dependents_Yes                | 0.2485     |


### **K-Nearest Neighbor

In K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), determining feature importance is not straightforward because KNN is a distance-based algorithm rather than a model that assigns explicit weights to features like decision trees or linear regression.

#### Model Accuracy
| Metric               | Score  |
|----------------------|--------|
| Model accuracy score | 0.7370 |


#### K-Fold Cross Validation - 10 Fold

| Average cross-validation score | 0.7416 |
| Lowest cross-validation score  | 0.7221 |
| Highest cross-validation score | 0.7627 |


#### GridSearchCV Best Parameters

| classifier__weights    | uniform         |
| Best score       |        0.7767     |


### **Random Forest**
Understanding which features impact customer churn is crucial for improving retention strategies. The table below displays the **feature importance scores** from a trained **Random Forest model**. These scores indicate how much each feature contributes to predicting whether a customer will churn.

 **Tenure Months (0.168)** is the most important factor, meaning customers who have been with the company longer are less likely to churn.
 **Monthly Charges (0.143)** is also significant, so pricing plays a key role in retention.
 Features like **Internet Service Type, Contract Type** also contribute to churn prediction.
 **Demographic factors like gender and senior citizenship** play a smaller role.

### **DecisionTreeClassifier**

The Decision Tree Classifier was chosen to address the unbalanced dataset that we have.

Various scoring methods and weights were tested to address the issue of the unbalanced dataset. However, the most suited scoring method that was found during the process is the 'balanced_accuracy'. The best weights found was {0:0.5, 1:1.5}.

The decision tree was build with 24 features. However, the most important features are :

| Feature                         | Importance |
|--------------------------------|:----------:|
| Contract_Two year            | 0.354717   |

| Online Security_Yes          | 0.003894   |
| Senior Citizen_Yes           | 0.003683   |

In addition, the final decision tree classifier had a depth of 6.

**Explanation of Metrics:**

>    **Precision**: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.</br>
     **Recall**: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.</br>
     **F1-score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.</br>
     **Support**: The number of actual occurrence</br>

# Validation of best model (Ramdom Forest), of balanced model (DecisionTreeClassifier) and of client's model (Churn Score)
---
In this notebook, we will be validating and comparing different models together

Here are the three models that will be validated and for which we will be comparing the results:
1. The best model found, which is a Random Forest model, based on the accuracy score.
2. The best model based on the balanced accuracy score, which is a Decision Tree Classifier model.
3. The client's actual model from which the Churn Score is calculated.


## Results

The accuracy is not the only scores that matters. As seen during this project, the scoring method best suited to optimize a Classification model is really dependent on the goal that the model need to achieve.

In this case, the client wanted to forecast the hit event the most accurately while minimizing the missed event. Therefore, a scoring method that would have balanced the dataset and try to find the best model that tend to have 0 False Negative, while optimizing the balanced accuracy would have been the best scoring method for this project.

</br></br>

It is a lesson learn that a model with the most accuracy does not always provide the best forecast.

We were not able to provide a better model than the pre-existing model used to produce the Churn Score and suit better the client's needs.

# Conclusion
---
We learned a valuable lesson.  that a model with the most accuracy does not always provide the best forecast.

We were not able to provide a better model than the pre-existing client's model used to produce the Churn Score.
